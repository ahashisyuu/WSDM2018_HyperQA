# HyperQA

Code for WSDM 2018 Paper

"*Hyperbolic Representation Learning for Fast and Efficient Neural Question Answering*" - Yi Tay, Anh Tuan Luu, Siu Cheung Hui - Proceedings of WSDM 2018.

https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.07847

This repository contains a reference implementation of HyperQA (which is merely copied from the main experiment repository I have). It is helpful for
some details that I had no space to report in the actual paper. 

I had to strip away some components from other models and also copy paste from my own library. Therefore, some dependencies may be missing for now. A running version with Preprocessing or training scripts will be uploaded when I have time. 

Coming Soon. Cleanin in Progress..
